@835 = ~Oh, damn! I'm hit!~ [SHRAR]
@836 = ~Let me see. Hey, it's nothing serious. Just a little scratch.~
@837 = ~Then get out if you're not going to help! I can do it myself *she clumsily puts a bandage on the wound*... ugh... devil!~
@838 = ~You don't follow basic combat tactic as a matter of principle, or you've never heard of them? This way we'll use up all the healing potions we have on you.~
@839 = ~Shut up and heal!~
@840 = ~*You apply a bandage of healing ointment to her as best you can* Quiet, tigress, don't move. Okay... done. Now, what do you need to say?~
@841 = ~Ho-ho! How about...: finally, you're making yourself useful, you wuss! Oops. Did I say that out loud? What a pity.~
@842 = ~On my way! *You immediately bandage her with healing ointment, almost without touching her wound* Are you all right?~
@843 = ~Not bad at all... and quick you are. Good boy. Tell me the truth, did you save a bandage for your wounds or for mine?~
@844 = ~To heal OUR wounds, of course. I mean, it's just the usual routine.~
@845 = ~Really? Then why did you turn pale when you bandaged me?~
@846 = ~*You have an indifferent look on your face as you bandage her wound.* Next time I may not be there to protect you. You should learn to do it yourself.~
@847 = ~Now back off.~
@848 = ~You barely hurt, you wimp. Come back to line.~
@849 = ~Then get lost if you're not helping! *she clumsily applies a bandage to the wound* Ugh...! devil!~
@850 = ~Have you ever had to help someone? Heal others, I mean. At least without seriously injuring your comrades.~
@851 = ~Looky looky here - the clever dick himself! Well, well don't stare at me like that. I only did that once. And because I am in a good mood today, I can even tell you why I did it. Back in the Pits, I was sleeping with a fighter called the Bull. You know, the kind of fighter with a lot of muscle and not much brains. He was a stupid and cruel animal.~
@852 = ~Wait, let me guess, you're going to talk about how strong you are, and how you'll triumphantly end up beating that poor weak male in the end, right?~
@853 = ~Who does it remind me of? A companion of some sort who is as cruel as she is heartless…~
@854 = ~Damn you! I'll tell you nothing in that case.~
@855 = ~I'm sorry. I know you have an intelligence of 14. Please continue.~
@856 = ~That's right, male. *She rumbles smugly* One day you're going to pray, and pray hard, for my strength and my intelligence. As for the Bull, unlike you, he always charged without thinking. By the way, why can't I remember a single fight where you didn't have one eye squinting for cover?~
@857 = ~I might not be willing to take risks for myself - like a bare-knuckle fight with an angry minotaur. Or waking you up on time and putting you on guard. But that time may come.~
@858 = ~*Your amazon playfully punches you in the liver* I knew that you're a coward. Be thankful for your Gods, weakling, that you have me.~
@859 = ~I just wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for having you in my squad. Your contributions are truly appreciated.~
@860 = ~*She shuts up for a second, and blushes (but maybe you just imagined it)* Ahem...! I've never had my arse kissed like this in my entire life. Whatever... could you remind me what we were talking about?~
@861 = ~Your skills are amazing. But I did want to bring to your attention to the fact that working with Your Brilliance Ladyship, we have experienced a rapid depletion of our potion supply. ~
@862 = ~You bloody flatterer! Is that how you flirt with me? You won't be able to save on our potions, so you'll be buying new ones, you boy! What was I talking about earlier?~
@863 = ~Because I'm the team leader. And as the team leader, it's my responsibility to ensure everyone's safety.~
@864 = ~Blah, blah, blah... of course. I vouch for my skills with my head. So shut up and appreciate it. Now, what was I telling you about?~
@865 = ~Because "discretion is the better part of valour". These are your words, by the way.~
@866 = ~Do you remember my words? *Amazon shuts up for a second, and blushes (but maybe you just imagined it).* Ahem...! Stop talking rubbish! What was I talking about earlier?~
@867 = ~You were talking about how you helped your lover in the Pits.~
@868 = ~To my ex-lover, actually. So, the Bull only ever defeated the weaker ones and thus "victoriously" earned a place at my feet. Sometimes I even felt a kind of affection for him... but only until he started talking.~
@869 = ~Usually, I told him to shut up and give me a foot massage... But one time he dared to talk dirty about women, in front of me. So I ordered him to tell his mates about our fun.~
@870 = ~Sounds... very humiliating as for me.~
@871 = ~Yeah, just like I thought. And when women serve you - men - and then you discuss them with your hyena buddies - then you don't have a problem with that, do you? Pfft! Male scum!~
@872 = ~Hmm. That sounds... pretty fair.~
@873 = ~It's "pretty fair", you said? Would you do this?~
@874 = ~If I really had feelings of love for a woman, I would definitely be the one to take care of her. Furthermore, I would correct any of my friends who dare to speak impolite about her. And I certainly wouldn't be ashamed of anything about our relationship.~
@875 = ~Is that so? What a pleasant surprise... that you are so gallant. Perhaps you should start by massaging my feet... I will certainly remember your words. Let's see what you're good for.~
@876 = ~Hmm.~
@877 = ~What, you have nothing to say? You're all the same, you male rabble.~
@878 = ~Did he obey your order?~
@879 = ~No. All he cared about was his worthless pals and their Damn judgement of him! So I left him.~
@880 = ~But one day the Bull himself came to me with pleas and apologies. He had a difficult battle ahead of him, with the Calishite, a warrior-thief. I advised him to equip with a short sword instead of his two-handed hammer - but he did not listen to me. Instead, he asked me to break his ears, but in such a way that none of his friends would know.~
@881 = ~To break his ears? Why?~
@882 = ~To intimidate his opponents, of course. I broke off both of his ears and demanded that he pay me as usual... foot massage.~
@883 = ~When he did that, I would pull him up by his swollen ears. Ha ha! I still laugh when I think of it. He would moo in pain like a real calf. And then, instead of training, he went out drinking with his rabble, bragging about his imminent victory over Calishite.~
@884 = ~So how'd it end? Did your "help" come in handy?~
@885 = ~The Bull didn't last a minute. The Calishite won the fight with a couple of quick rolls, and at the end he drove a dagger into the back of the Bull. The Bull's severed head with its broken ears was... raised above the arena. Oh, it was a sight to behold!~
@886 = ~I can't decide what's more in this story: tragedy or stupidity. How many such stories do you have from the Pits?~
@887 = ~He should have listened to you. So how many such stories do you have from the Pits?~
@888 = ~Oh, I have lots of them.  Now I can see why I have so much fun telling them to you.~
@889 = ~Why?~
@890 = ~It's simple. You always listen to these stories with interest. And, I hope, you learn lessons for yourself. For your future. ~
@891 = ~I don't give in to provocations. But if you start saying something unacceptable, then you have to answer for your words.~

@26 = ~Then I'd beat Drizzt.~

@35 = ~We had a male dog from the Battle Pits; we sometimes used dogs for fighting. The bitches were kept separate. If Fast sensed a bitch in heat nearby, he would howl all day and then smash his and her kennels to pieces at night. Your eyes are the same as Fast's when he sniffed out the bitch.~
@36 = ~Oh, really?~
@37 = ~I see the way you look at me. With desire and lust. And you want to flatter me to share a sleeping bag with me. So, know this: flattery will not help you, male.~
@38 = ~Who knows? Fast did it all right.~
@39 = ~I didn't mean to do that. You're just wishful thinking.~
@40 = ~Oh, yeah.~

// PC - Shar-Teel (romance talk 2)

Or will I have more friends? Nothing will change, it will only get worse; I will have to work from morning till night, and everyone will want to kill me to take my place.

@203 = ~I'm not a lady, as you well know. But why not.~
@204 = ~*You decide to cut ties with the Shar-Teel before it becomes a big problem* Yeah, I wanted to talk. I think our relationship has gone too far. Let's stay friends.~
@205 = ~*Shar-Teel looks surprised, but holds back her emotions* Hmph. As you know.~
@206 = ~*You pour her a love potion: the "Passionate Maiden", tart-tasting red wine, the strongest on Faerun, bought in advance from the priestess of the goddess Sune*~
@207 = ~Not a bad wine. You know my taste. So, what did you want?~
@208 = ~You know what I want. Isn't that why you took a bath for two whole hours?~
@209 = ~I kept waiting for you to come peeking at me. Before the water got cold.~
@210 = ~A male will always be a male. A dumb, lustful animal that a woman only uses only for entertainment.~
@211 = ~Since you mentioned entertainment... you know, I'd like you to please me in the same way that the priestesses of Loviatar please the men.~
@212 = ~So that's the leg you're limping on, huh! Have you been dreaming about this for a long time? Getting under my heel?~
@213 = ~Since I met you. Are you... are you judging me?~
@214 = ~I was just... fantasizing. Are you judging me?~
@215 = ~I've never judged you on anything, ever. Well maybe before... but not for real. If you slaughter a hundred priestesses from Selune's temple tomorrow, I'll just help you bury their corpses. In all the Realms, I have no one closer to me than you!~
@216 = ~*You embrace Shar-Teel and seal her lips to yours. Your long kiss already seems impossible to end. Eventually Shar-Teel gently pulls you away, remembering to bite your lip lightly.*~

@218 = ~It's like she missed two blows at once: to the head and to the stomach! You hugged me so hard my eyes went black. Wait, let me see, what did you want? Oh, right, Loviatar.~

@227 = ~Wow. What happened to the old, fearsome Shar-Teel? Now you look like a normal woman, kind and caring.~
@228 = ~I know. It was all leading up to this. I'll be damned if I thought I'd be subservient to your every whim.~
@229 = ~Is it that bad?~
@230 = ~You didn't like it?~
@231 = ~You think it went too far?~
@232 = ~No, not at all. I just feel bad because of my weakness... This is the first time this has happened to me.~
@233 = ~But thank you. It's been wonderful.~
@234 = ~Thank you too. I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing...~
@235 = ~Really? I didn't sense any insecurity in you. You knew exactly what you wanted.~

@237 = ~Right on, partner! *Shar-Teel jokingly punches you in the side* A day will not pass by when you come back for more.~
@238 = ~While you were sleeping, I was thinking.~
@239 = ~About what?~
@240 = ~I thought you've become a bloody lord or duke, whatever like that. And then you married some rich, full-blooded aristocratic bitch who would give you heirs year after year.~
@241 = ~This option was possible.~
@242 = ~Maybe one day. But now I would like to see this adventure through to the end. ~
@243 = ~No, it's not for me.  I like adventure too much.~
@244 = ~Also, I remembered Belkunya, the familiar gnoll from the Fighting Pits. Between fights, we sometimes talked about men. She told me that her greatest regret was that her Gar-Ragh would never return. She said the world had died when he was gone.~
@245 = ~Did the gnoll leave her?~
@246 = ~Did the gnoll died?~
@247 = ~No. They lived a friendly, good life together. Or so Belkunya lied, it doesn't matter. He died in battle right before her eyes. A few years before Pits.~
@248 = ~Yes. They lived a friendly, good life together. Or so Belkunya lied, it doesn't matter. He died in battle right before her eyes. A few years before Pits.~
@249 = ~And what happened next?~
@250 = ~I mocked Belkunya then, for her story. I regret it now, the Gods know. And two fights later she was cut down. But I think she really died when she lost her male.~
@251 = ~Sad story. Such love is almost never found among gnolls.~
@252 = ~Really? Still... still she was happy with him. But that's not what I mean. She told me that Gar-Ragh liked to dominate her.~
@253 = ~I thought female gnolls were taller and stronger than males gnolls?~
@254 = ~Gar-Ragh did whatever he wanted with her. The fact that he was a head shorter than her did not bother him. He kept her on a short leash: she say him only "yes sir" or "no sir". I remember her stories sometimes. And I can understand why you wanted me to punish you.~
@255 = ~Wait. Are you saying that you, um... you want the same thing?~
@256 = ~Exactly. You and I are similar in our desires. So next time it's mine. I want you to try the whip on me. And I want you to put a collar on me.~
@257 = ~I see. I...~
@258 = ~*Shar-Teel stands up, with the heavy-handed grace of a warrioress* Don't say anything. I know that men can't keep their mouths shut, and that everyone already knows we're sleeping together.~
@259 = ~But no one should find out about our games - it could hurt you in the future.~
@260 = ~One more thing, lover boy. You belong to me now. And you only sleep with me. I want all your affairs on the side to be over. Immediately.~
@261 = ~So mote it be. I want to see you collared as my obedient... subservient. ~
@262 = ~Yeah... Will you dare yourself to me, boy? ~
@263 = ~Well. But now you are mine too. ~
@264 = ~Now I see the awakening of a jealous male. Of course I'm with you. As long as we are together, I will be faithful to you. Then ... let's see what happens next.~
@265 = ~And don't you dare lie to me, boy.~
@266 = ~I'm afraid I can't promise you that yet. I haven't decided yet how serious our relationship is.~
@267 = ~*Amazon stares at you stunned, then explodes with rage* "Haven't decided yet!?" Are you kidding me!!!? I... I can't believe it. What an idiot I am! ~
@268 = ~Wait, Shar-Teel... ~
@269 = ~Get away from me! Go to hell!!!~
@270 = ~Since you mentioned entertainment... you know, I...~
@271 = ~*Shar-Teel cuts you off with a kiss* Oh yeah, I know what you want!~
@272 = ~*You tear each other's clothes off and soon merge in loving ecstasy. Unable to contain herself Shar-Teel moans in pleasure, encouraging you to take her more and more greedily and roughly. Her nails dig into your back and you both reach the peak of bliss. Exhausted, you fall asleep cuddled together.*~
@273 = ~*Shar-Teel greets your awakening with a smile: pleased and slightly sarcastic* My hero is finally awake. ~
@274 = ~While you were sleeping, I was thinking.~
@275 = ~About us. About you. And about myself. I've never felt so good. Even better than when I'm crushing your enemies in battle. ~
@276 = ~Sounds like a declaration of love, the Bearess.~
@277 = ~It feels good to be with you. It's good to know who's friend and who's foe. It's good to fall asleep next to each other, in the same sleeping bag. And listen to all the smart crap you talk about. Sometimes I feel like I don't know anything about the world I live in.~
@278 = ~*Instead of answering, you squeeze Shar-Teel's hand lightly. And you decide not to tell her that she snores when she sleeps. You're starting to like the sound of it anyway.*~
@279 = ~Devil, we should get up. Which Shar-Teel does, with the heavy grace of a warrioress*~
@280 = ~I know that men can't keep their mouths shut, and that everyone already knows we're sleeping together. But I don't want to give them any more fodder for gossip.~
@281 = ~And why did you remember that?~

@293 = ~*Your fearless companion begins to moan softly; her eyes mist up and her breathing quickens* Yes! Yes... Master!~
@294 = ~*With a fluid motion, she drops to one knee, drawing her sword from its scabbard and holding it upright before her. She looks up at you, her expression serious and determined.* By the blood of my woman ancestors an' the honour of mine, I, Shar-Teel, h'reby pledge myself unto thee, <CHARNAME>, as thy faithful slave. May the Goddess of Darkness witness my oath. I am thine to command, Master.~

@462 = ~*Shar-Teel shakes off your hand with a rock face and walks away. You have a feeling she won't be coming back.*~
@463 = ~*You expect an outburst of rage in response, but the warrioress just frowns, silent. All of her bravado, swagger, and anger seem to have left her at once. Now there she is, soaking wet in the rain, hushed and totally unlike herself.*~
@464 = ~How many years have you been a mercenary?~
@465 = ~I don't remember anymore... Why are you saying all this to me? Everything was going so well, and now... ~
@466 = ~Because this conversation is long overdue.~
@467 = ~You don't understand nothing! I feel like you're robbing me! I just can't... to be disarmed. I don't know how to do anything else but slash...~
@468 = ~What good would I be... if...~
@469 = ~*You press her palm to your chest; your heart is beating hard like in a hard fight* You are the best fighter I know. And you're right: the steel bound us together and all was great. But all wars in the Realms come to an end at some point.~
@470= ~*She listens to you intently*~
@471 = ~And I don't intend to fight forever. There will come a time, and we will part.~
@472 = ~But we can stay together. We can, no, not like this - we HAVE to go on. I've dreamed for a long time that you would learn to live in peace.~
@473 = ~Peace? For me? You're confusing me with someone else, <CHARNAME>.~
@474 = ~I'm not confusing you with anyone. I care about your fate, Shar-Teel. I want to be with you. I want us to have a home.~
@475 = ~Maybe so. But I care about your fate, Shar-Teel. I want to be with you. But we can't live by the sword alone. We can live differently if we want.~
@476 = ~Maybe you're right. Let's leave everything as is. Forget about this conversation.~
@477 = ~*Looks at you in confusion* A home? You mean our... home?~
@478 = ~*Looks at you in surprise* Live differently? The son of Bhaal and the Nightbringer of Shar? Ha! Do you seriously think that we will live to old age?~
@479 = ~*Looks at you in confusion* It will be difficult to forget. But I will try. Never return to this topic again. Never!~
@480 = ~Yes, our home. With those colorful curtains on the windows.~
@481 = ~Quite. Fate will not always dictate our actions. We are strong enough to choose our own path. When our journey ends, it will be time to decide what to do next. And I have already decided. And you?~
@482 = ~*The amazon is clearly confused, this is the first time you have seen her like this during the entire journey*~
@483 = ~*Well, now it's your time to speak the language of the brave. You swallow a lump in your throat, fumble for the cherished ring in your pocket, and get down on one knee* I love you and I ask you to be my wife. What do you say, the Bearess?~
@484 = ~I want to spend the rest of my life with you, I want to have children. I'm not asking you to marry me if you don't want to - all these rituals are not necessary. But I need you. What do you say, the Bearess?~
@485 = ~*Maybe you're pushing her too hard? You decide to back off* Maybe you're right. Let's leave it as is. Forget about this conversation. Let's not think about the future.~
@486 = ~*Just by Shar-Teel's heaving chest and dazed expression, she certainly wasn't ready for this. There's a long silence between the two of you; only the sound of rain and her heavy breathing can be heard. Shar-Teel tries to say something a couple of times, but stops before she can start her words. Finally, she gathers her thoughts.*~
@487 = ~I... I need to think. Alone. I'm sorry!~
@488 = ~*In one move, without looking, Shar-Teel grabs her sword from the ground and throws it into its scabbard. Then she turns and quickly disappears into the darkness.*~
@489 = ~I've been wanting to do some serious business for a long time. There's a lot of gold here in Athkatla. All we have to do is reach out and take it.~
@490 = ~Really? That's a good.~
@491 = ~I need you for this. I not only want to acquire wealth and power; I want to share it with you.~
@492 = ~*Looks at you in confusion* You want me to be your...~
@493 = ~My wife, yes. *Well, the decisive moment has come. You confidently feel for the wedding ring in your pocket and hold it out to Shar-Teel.* I ask for your hand. What do you say, the Bearess?~
@494 = ~My life partner, yes. Ceremonies and rings are not for us, but we can tie our destinies together without them when our journey is over. I want to be with you until the end of my days. What do you say, the Bearess?~
@495 = ~You know, forget it. Let's leave it as is. Let's not think about the future.~
@496 = ~*There's a long silence between the two of you; only the sound of rain and her heavy breathing can be heard. Shar-Teel tries to say something a couple of times, but stops before she can start her words. Finally, she gathers her thoughts.*~
@497 = ~Wait...!~
@498 = ~*Shar-Teel leaves, and only silence is heard in response.*~
@499 = ~Don't touch her, <CHARNAME>. She's better be alone right now.~
@500 = ~I never thought he'd have the courage to propose to HER. ~
@501 = ~Sh-h! Nothing has been decided yet.~
@502 = ~*Couragingly pats your hand* She'll be fine. Don't worry. ~
@503 = ~You think so?~
@504 = ~Of course. Did you see how briskly she ran away? Breaking bushes as well as a wild boar, hehe. No one don't act like that in sorrow. She'll be back. You'll see.~
@505 = ~Maybe I should walk on air, huh? Don't ask me for something I don't have, <CHARNAME>. I thought about peace before you, and...~
@506 = ~So what?~
@507 = ~Because somewhere, a sword has already been sharpened that will chop off my head. How many of those I started with have already been laid to rest in their graves - those were lucky, but most of them have disappeared without a trace. The same will happen to me - there's nothing you can do about it, right?~
@508 = ~Thank you. You always know what to say.~

// PC - Shar-Teel (romance talk 12)
@509 = ~<CHARNAME>... Hey.~ [SHRAR]
@510 = ~Shar-Teel!~
@511 = ~I've been thinking all day about what to say to you, but I can't think of anything.~
@512 = ~Do you remember when you picked me up in the middle of nowhere? It's been a long time.~
@513 = ~It was in the Mutamin's Garden. That's where you challenged me to a fight.~
@514 = ~If ever the Gods ever smiled on me, it was when you defeated me. I wasn't even mad at you for losing.~
@515 = ~You weren't angry at all?~
@516 = ~Well, only for half a day. ~
@517 = ~Do you realize that I'm not fit for marriage, don't you? I... I'll try, but when you spend your whole life just fighting...~
@518 = ~I don't need anybody but you. From the moment we met. ~
@519 = ~I believe that everything will work out for us if we both want it.~
@520 = ~I love you too. That's it, now I've said it.~
@521 = ~Mee too.~
@522 = ~I knew you would come back.~
@523 = ~It was in the Mutamin's Garden. That's where you challenged me to a fight.~
@524 = ~Do you really want us to be together? Say it again.~
@525 = ~I don't need anybody but you. .~
@526 = ~I want to be with you too. To stand beside you, to be side by side in battle. I never thought I'd say this, but... I agree.~
@527 = ~When we finish our adventure, we can think about a wedding... I guess. For a priestess of Shar, it will be a little... unusual.~
@528 = ~Of course, without any ceremonies or weddings. I don't need that, you know me.~
@529 = ~Don't Shar's followers ever get married?~
@530 = ~Do you think Shar would disapprove of that?~
@531 = ~We don't have to follow Shar's precepts in everything, right? Free will hasn't been abolished.~
@532 = ~Not exactly. Since Shar is the goddess of loss, I would think the point of marriage would be to get divorced. How do I explain that? Like giving your kid a dog then making your kid kill their dog in a 'trial of manhood'.~
@533 = ~So like, you can get married, and shar will approve of it even, but it's with the expectation that you are gaining something in order to eventually lose it.~
@534 = ~Like how shadows need light to exist, Shar would be in favor of people gaining things so that they can lose them.~


// Liora encounter
@535 = ~*Suddenly, a woman appears in front of Shar-Teel, resembling a priestess of Shar, in black armor and helmet, with a mace in her hand.*~
@536 = ~Stay where you are! You bloody traitress!~
@537 = ~Liora!?~
@538 = ~In the name of Shar! You have been sentenced for apostasy! You promised to bring us a captive Bhaal Spawn. And here he is, just look at him: he is free, and you are in his service!~
@539 = ~Ahahaha! The "death sentence" you said? - don't make me laugh! And who did it: you and your Chondathan mate? No, he was hanged a month ago. Thou are a stupid bitch, thou know that? It is only the Chapter of the Nightbringers that can judge me.~
@540 = ~If you get out of our way quietly, I'll spare thou, so be it. Get lost.~
@541 = ~You've given no mercy to anyone, ever!~
@542 = ~*She shifts her angry gaze to you* So the rumours weren't lying - that's why she betrayed Shar, it's all because of you, you Bhaal Spawn! First, I'll teach her to respect the Church as she should. Then I'll come and deal with you!~
@543 = ~Who is she? I see you two know each other.~
@544 = ~This is Liora, high priestess of Shar, we call her the Mad. I was tasked with guarding her long ago when I was an acolyte.~
@545 = ~What was she talking about? Did you have a mission... concerning me?~
@546 = ~Liora told the truth. Right after you arrived in Athkatla and before we became close, I promised the Sharran, or rather her, to, well... um... bring you to them. I'm very sorry.~
@547 = ~So that's how it is. Did you purport to captivate me and capture me?~
@548 = ~Please don't be angry, CHARNAME. I am loyal to you in everything, you know that. How was I to know then that you would really arrive in Amn?~
@549 = ~I understand this... and I'm not angry. But it would be bad to ignore the threats of this Liora.~
@550 = ~Don't worry about her - she's no danger to us. And know the truth:  Shar's influence in the South is greatly exaggerated. *She grins grimly at you* Who should know that better than me.~
@551 = ~You lied to me all this time, you were going to betray me! After this, I won't be able to trust you like before. You better leave.~
@552 = ~I can't say I'm happy about what I've heard. But never mind: we'll discuss it later. In the meantime, don't go searching for her yourself. I think this sharran is serious, and probably expects to pick us off one by one. We should stick together.~
@553 = ~Of course we'll do what you say. I will follow your lead.~
@554 = ~You are somehow suspiciously easy to agree with me....~
@555 = ~No need for suspicion, my hero. You are right - we are stronger together.~
@556 = ~Good. Will you get any trouble with your church because of it?~
@557 = ~The Mad is too lowly to worry about her. She will NOT be heard. ~
@558 = ~What?! Are you serious? Is this because of some crazy priestess and my past mistakes?~
@559 = ~Are you sure you're doing the right thing, <CHARNAME>? Shar-Teel has been with us for a long time and has helped us a lot...~
@560 = ~I wouldn't trust anything anyone would say if they were planning such a betrayal.~
@561 = ~I'm sure Shar-Teel means what she says, <CHARNAME>. I've gotten to know her well lately.~
@562 = ~Sometimes you have to make the hard decision to cut a rotten branch from a tree, <CHARNAME>.~
@563 = ~That's right, <CHARNAME>. I've always believed she couldn't be trusted.~
@564 = ~Once someone has betrayed someone, they can easily do it again. I'm all for kicking her out.~
@565 = ~Wise Tiax knew she was a traitor from the start! But he didn't say anything because she paid him to keep quiet!~
@566 = ~What? I didn't pay you anything, stupid dwarf! Shut up!~
@567 = ~Really? So someone else paid me for this... Hmm-hmm. There's another traitor among us!!!~
@568 = ~Love sometimes does wonderful things to us and changes our views and characters, <CHARNAME>. I saw how this black crow became an oriole when she got close to you. But you're the one making the decisions here, of course.~
@569 = ~Perhaps she did make a mistake, <CHARNAME>, but you can't just kick her out like that. Everyone deserves a second chance.~
@570 = ~Okay, Shar-Teel, stay with the squad.~
@571 = ~I've made my decision. It's best for you to leave.~
@572 = ~*Shar-Teel is extremely confused and angry, but she's not going to argue - after such words, she clearly can't stand being around you.*~
@573 = ~*Shar-Teel is clearly offended by this attitude. She stays with you, but you feel that the trust between you will never be the same again.*~
@574 = ~*The strange priestess teleports away before you can intervene. Shar-Teel is silent and tries not to look you in the eye*~

// PC - Shar-Teel (romance talk 13)
@575 = ~We're alone at last. But I'll have to depart soon. There is a work for me that needs to be done.~ [SHRAR]
@576 = ~What kind of work?~
@577 = ~Actually, I'm not allowed to talk about the mission, but since you're my superior now... The Sharran have hired me to guard their cargo.~
@578 = ~Incense, ambergris and Sembian silk will be transported by sea to the High Priestess of Murann. From there, we'll go to Velen and sell what's left. ~
@579 = ~To the Land of Intrigue?~
@580 = ~To the Land of Intrigue? I've heard that the Selune influence is strong in Murann.~
@581 = ~As usual, you know everything, smart-ass~
@582 = ~It's like this luxury will be used to bribe our rivals, but I don't believe it. It's more likely that the High Priestess of Shar in Murann will take it all for herself. *Her face twists with displeasure* A priestess of Shar shouldn't live like that.~
@583 = ~Why does the Church of Shar need this delivery? They are not simple traders.~
@584 = ~Tell me more about your mission.~
@585 = ~Since when did you start guarding caravans?~
@586 = ~Why do you need it?~
@587 = ~It's no big deal – I'll just sit in the hold of the ship the whole damn way. I'm a Heraldess of the Night, so I guard the property of the Church of the Night. That's the only way you can make a career in the Church; every first one there serves as an errand boy for important Church bosses. ~
@588 = ~I must seek your permission to embark on my mission. Nearly akin to a verse, innit?~
@589 = ~I don't need your permission to go on a mission, but I'm going to ask anyway.~
@590 = ~I don't like this very much. How long are you sailing for?~
@591 = ~What if I don't want you to leave? We have enough gold, after all.~
@592 = ~I'm against it. You're more needed here. Let the Shar priests look for someone else.~
@593 = ~How long will you be away?~
@594 = ~I don't want to leave either. But when I finish the Sharran mission, they'll be gone for a long time and that "incident" with Liora can be forgotten.  And there's never too many gold, you know.~
@595 = ~For a week and a half, maybe two. The Sharran will pay a thousand coins; I'll leave you the advance - there's nowhere to spend it. And I'll get food from the ship's stores; anyway, I lose my appetite when you're not around.~
@596 = ~Please tell me you'll let me go.~
@597 = ~Well, you can ship out. Except for your ration, everything looks acceptable.~
@598 = ~Thank you. We need that gold.~
@599 = ~Well, you can ship out. But I still don't want to be separated from you.~
@600 = ~Be patient. That gold will come in handy for us in the future. ~
@601 = ~Well... I didn't want to say this, but I guess I'll have to.~
@602 = ~Remember that priestess of Shar, Liora? She plotted against me and you, and could have made the entire church of Shar our enemies.~
@603 = ~I had to... deal with this. Recently, while everyone was sleeping, I went away and... solved this problem.~
@604 = ~And what exactly did you do?~
@605 = ~Did you kill her?~
@606 = ~Liora lies on the seabed and will not bother anyone again. I brought this problem upon us - I had to solve it. And I solved it as best I can.~
@607 = ~But the Sharrans will probably find her body soon - with the help of magic. And to clear me of suspicion in her murder, I need an alibi. So I'll set sail, so that when the body is found, I won't be in the city.~
@608 = ~Besides, I'll show my devotion to Shar, fulfill my duty to her, and the priests will leave us alone for a long time.~
@609 = ~Now you understand that this is necessary. I have no choice.~
@610 = ~*You pull Shar-Teel tightly against you and are trapped in the iron embrace of her hug. For a while, you just stand there, embracing and savouring each other's closeness.*~
@611 = ~You smell of mugwort and also steel and leather. A nice perfume.~
@612 = ~Really? I'm glad. I spent half a day looking for perfuming artemisia on the Promenade. I didn't even know if you'd like the bitterness. They only have one oriental perfume that is all sweet and musky, yuck, gross! ~
@613 = ~Really? I'm glad. Me and Imoen spent half a day looking for perfuming artemisia on the Promenade. I didn't even know if you'd like the bitterness. They only have one oriental perfume that is all sweet and musky, yuck, gross! ~
@614 = ~Really? I'm glad. Me and Safana spent half a day looking for perfuming artemisia on the Promenade. I didn't even know if you'd like the bitterness. They only have one oriental perfume that is all sweet and musky, yuck, gross!~
@615 = ~Druids often use mugwort as an ingredient to make healing potions. It’s a useful herb. ~
@616 = ~I read somewhere that lovers who don't like each other's smell are bound to break up.~
@617 = ~That's true, I've heard that too. But I like your smell. I really, really do.~
@618 = ~Your skin smells like ghost violets - I once slept in a clearing full of them and remembered their smell.  I guess that's what a girl should smell like, young and beautiful. Who needs to be loved.~
@619 = ~*You try to object, but Shar-Teel's tongue is already in your mouth, and your hands are wrapped behind your back by her strong arms in such a way that you can't move. Finally, Shar-Teel pulls away from you, only to make a mark on your neck with her lips.*~
@620 = ~You'll always be my favourite toy, elf.~
@621 = ~*You decide to remain silent*~
@622 = ~As you wish.~
@623 = ~*Smiles smugly* That's it.~
@624 = ~You smell of field herbs... and healing potions like some herbalist's shop. What's your favourite flower?~
@625 = ~The red poppy is a favourite of mine. It's strong and hardy flower. There's an old belief that poppies always grow in abundance on battlefields... I have seen a field like that once. *Shar-Teel pauses thoughtfully.*~
@626 = ~Yeah, by the way, what about Liora, remember, that priestess who threatened us?~
@627 = ~I reported her, and she was called away from Athkatla, somewhere to the North. Right now, I think, she is lighting a fire in the hearth of her steamy, gloomy hut. She'd been a thorn in the Church's eye for a long time. ~
@628 = ~Are you telling me the truth?~
@629 = ~I wouldn't lie to you.~
@630 = ~Good thing we didn't have to eliminate that threat. We have enough problems as it is.~
@631 = ~Good. But, still, I don't understand what made her take that step. Was it that madness, as you said...?~
@632 = ~No one can really tell what's on a madman mind. Let's not talk about her. That little mutt won't bother us again.~
@633 = ~Okey. By the way, I have a present for you, my lioness.~
@634 = ~Your present is in your trousers, and I'm going to get it tonight - whether you want it or not. And I KNOW you want it. ~
@635 = ~But you've piqued my interest. What's the gift?~
@636 = ~Here. The master craftsman who made this collar said it gives good protection against fire. *You give her the collar made from Hellhound leather which you purchased from the craftsman on Waukåån's Promenade.*~
@637 = ~It says, “Bad Girl.” That's so cute! Thank you! ~
@638 = ~*In a burst of emotion, the amazon kisses you, then immediately frees herself from the armour and tries the collar on.* What do you think?~
@639 = ~It’s look great on you!~
@640 = ~I imagined it on you a little differently, but...~
@641 = ~I won't be wearing anything today except your gift.  And, since I'm a bad girl, I should be punished. Or you. Take out a coin.~
@642 = ~*You take a small coin out of your pocket. On one side of it is a helmet, on the other - a cloak. All that remains is to choose one of these images, and then toss the coin and find out which side will be on top*~
@643 = ~I choose a helmet!~
@644 = ~*You flip a coin...*~
@645 = ~*You decide to cheat a little (make the coin land with the helmet image facing up)*~
@646 = ~*You decide to cheat a little (make the coin land with the cloak image facing up)*~
@647 = ~*You decide to try a tricky trick (flip the coin so that it lands on its edge)*~
@648 = ~Helmet! Hooray! You're at my mercy today. Take off your clothes, male!~
@649 = ~*You obediently remove all your armour and clothing~
@650 = ~I'll be on your mind as long as I sail. Say it!~
@651 = ~All I will be thinking about is you, always.~
@652 = ~Good boy. But your place is down there.~
@653 = ~If you had nine lives, like a Mr. Cat, I would take one life from you. ~
@654 = ~What would you like to do with me?~
@655 = ~Hmm, you want to know if I'd devour you alive? Oh, yeah! I'd devour your quivering, raw flesh, and lovingly suck on every bone.~
@656 = ~It is very lucky for me that you're sailing tomorrow. That makes me feel reassured.~
@657 = ~I've got a fortnight of sailing on this old boat. So tonight, I'm going to squeeze every last bit of energy out of you!~
@658 = ~Do you intend to make love all night?~
@659 = ~I intend to do this for the rest of my life.~
@660 = ~And now...!  *Her muscular legs squeeze your ribs, and you begin to move together, becoming one, and soon, even your moans merge in unison.*~
@661 = ~*This sweet torture lasts, for hours. At the moment of climax, Shar-Teel stops holding back, and the triumphant moans of a satisfied alpha female echo throughout the area. You fall asleep only in the morning, completely exhausted, just as Shar-Teel promised you.*~
@662 = ~What do you think of Athkatla?~
@663 = ~I hate the South, I hate the Southerners and I hate this goddamn city! I swear Shar, I'd burn it to the ground if you didn't have a business interest here.~
@664 = ~Amnish silver-gold merchants and Calishites make me sick! - they're sneaky liars, cowards, always pawing at me with their oily eyes, and as soon as I walk by, they try to suck in their bellies, under their women's dressing gowns, yuck, disgusting! I once poked one of them in the stomach with a scabbard to hear him squeal. He screeched like a pig!~
@665 = ~You little racist pig! You just don't want to progress. Come on, grunt!~
@666 = ~*The warrioress hesitantly begins to grunt* Aye! Hrrr! I am a pig! Yes, that's who I am!~
@667 = ~That's right. You are my slave from now on.~
@668 = ~It is an honour to serve you, Master!~
@669 = ~Great. You were looking forward to the "cloak" more than the "helmet", weren't you? ~
@670 = ~*She smiles broadly at you* Oh, yeah!!~
@671 = ~*You knock your bearess off her feet with a powerful push (you're always ready to back up her fall, though)* This is your place in life now. On the ground at my feet. ~
@672 = ~Show me who's boss! Hurry up, step on me, and take a kingly pose. Pray tell, milord, show me my proper place beneath your heel.~
@673 = ~Are you okay..., I mean, do you want more, you insatiable pig!?~
@674 = ~Yes, that's not nearly enough, Master. Please take me from behind!~
@675 = ~*Without any further words, you wind Shar-Teel's hair around your fist and take her, mercilessly and roughly, spurred on by her loud moans. When your strength finally runs out, the indefatigable amazon climbs on top of you herself. The hours fly by, and you fall asleep in each other's arms in the morning.*~
@676 = ~Wow! That's the first time I've ever seen that. What are you gonna do, flip it again? ~
@677 = ~No. There's a rule: a coin on the edge means a foot massage for beloved wife.~
@678 = ~I'm all for it, handsome! Get to work.~
@679 = ~*You begin to gently massage her large and firm leg muscles*. And while we're together, I'd like to find out about... Shar clergy. I have sadly little knowledge of them.~
@680 = ~I knew you'd spoil the fun.~
@681 = ~Should I stop massaging your feet?~
@682 = ~Don't you dare take your hands off me! Yeah, that's it, lower! I'll tell you.~
@683 = ~You're not privy to our affairs. It's for your own good.~
@684 = ~Since you asked: many of the churchmen of Shar... what did you say? I've heard you use that word - living for pleasure?~
@685 = ~Hedonists?~
@686 = ~Exactly. Like hungry mites in the spring. Our clerics are faithless, don't like responsibility, and serve for one benefit only. They're the reason Shar is losing the war to Selune. *Shar-Teel's breathing is cut short as you kiss her toes. Yeah! That's it!~
@687 = ~Though Shar is a Great Deity, her might on Faerun is waning. There are not many of us Sharran, and we have no allies except the Church of Talona. Most folk of the Kingdoms have no sympathy for us or our dogma. All they want is to fill their bellies and have good lords over them. ~

@689 = ~*You go lower and massage Shar-Teel's feet with more force, making her start to moan softly* You think: was the collar worth it? ~
@690 = ~Gods, it was worth it! To hell with the church! Come here! I'll show you one Crinti technique...! *She pulls you to her in a confident and commanding motion, and you are entwined together in carnal games. The hours fly by and it is only in the morning that you fall asleep, wrung dry, just as Shar-Teel had promised.*~

@694 = ~No. You'll buy another pair, those were cheap.~
@695 = ~It's already time. Oh, for god's sake, what a headache! Don't see me off, you know I don't like it. I'll be back in a fortnight. *She kisses you* See you soon, cutie pie-hubby. ~

@698 = ~Shar-Teel! Are you back yet? How was the voyage?~
@699 = ~Oh, it's you. The voyage ended so quickly? How was it?~
@700 = ~Better than I expected! We almost got boarded, but Delia and I fought back. Delia is my partner, and this was also her first sailing, and her first assignment as a full priestess.~
@701 = ~Well, there was a hell of a lot of wo'er and waves around. The first two days were the worst because of the seasickness.~
@702 = ~It's nothing! Then we ran into a pirate tartan, or tarchid, in the fog.... Whatever, we were blown to smithereens! First, we got two fireballs right in the foremast, the sail burned right off, and then we got hit in the side with something. By the time we were ready to fight, the pirates were gone.~
@703 = ~The captain chickened out during the battle and huddled under a bench *scoffs* like a typical male. Delia burned her breasts when she put out the fire, so the captain had no mercy from her. She kicked him into the hold to bailing out the water. And she made me first mate.~
@704 = ~Will you introduce us?~
@705 = ~It looks like it was really interesting there.~
@706 = ~Absolutely not. Your acquaintanceship with women is a thing of the past.~

@709 = ~So are you going to be a sailor now? Or are you ready to travel with us again?~
@710 = ~It's just a big salty puddle, what could be interesting about it?~
@711 = ~Gentle, huh? Save your strength, pretty boy. It'll come in handy at night. ~
@712 = ~I liked it, but of course not enough to change my lifestyle. I'm back with you!~

@752 = ~'Mist of Dreams' would be great. So many problems lately demand my attention. No time to rest.~
@753 = ~I see. Here you go. Hold your breath as you inhale.~
@754 = ~I'm right behind you.~
@755 = ~*You inhale the lotus and everything in front of your eyes begins to blur and take on light, pleasant colours: jasmine, raspberry and cardamom. For some reason you find yourself thinking about tea, its varieties and how to brew it perfectly, while your eyelids become heavy - you need to lie down and rest.*~
@756 = ~*A flute seems to be playing somewhere in the distance, and this simple melody excites you, like an echo of events that once happened and now must happen again... anyway. Thrown away from you by a wave of serenity, Shar-Teel lies down nearby, like a pet tigress who has decided to stretch out her paws and rest in front of a welcoming hearth.*~
@757 = ~Well, what could be better for the man...? Let's try the 'Minotaur-Matador'.~
@758 = ~I'm curious myself. Here it is. It has a weaker effect on females, but it also makes them desire. ~
@759 = ~Hold your breath as you inhale. I'm right behind you.~
@760 = ~*You inhale the lotus and a little while later, through the narcotic daze, a specific thought begins to enter your mind. The thought that your damn seductive and accessible wife is right next to you*~

@767 = ~What's that for? Ah, that's..., I got it.~
@768 = ~I used to think of wine and lotus as a weakness. Even power potions I tried not to drink unless absolutely necessary. I saw how they made people worthless and dependent.~

// ToB, dialogue in Saradush
@771 = ~<CHARNAME>... We need to talk now. *Shar-Teel clears her throat, embarrassed* Remember when you said something about... marriage?~ [SHRAR]
@772 = ~Well, I think now is the time.~
@773 = ~Okay, but why now? I thought you wanted to take it slow.~
@774 = ~Great! I was just waiting for the right moment to propose. But with everything going on, it's not going to be that moment anytime soon.~
@775 = ~You know, I'm not sure I want to do this right now. There's too much death and pain out there, and I have a lot of trials ahead of me. I don't want you to suddenly become a widow.~
@776 = ~You know, I've changed my mind. We don't need marriage to stay together. All these ceremonies are for spoiled nobles, not for us.~
@777 = ~We've been living in constant battles for a long time, I'm used to it. But what's happening now is something... special. We're trapped, under fire and shelling, the city is besieged by an army of giants. Every day there's death, screams and fear. Before, I would have been happy about this, but now I look at things differently.~
@778 = ~And I thought - maybe this is a sign from the gods. Maybe they're reminding us to cherish every day we live. And if we get married now, against all odds, in a dying city, then by doing so we'll be... triumphing over death. I think Shar herself would approve of such a marriage - the marriage of two doomed people.~
@779 = ~Shar likes it when people get something, only to lose it later. She would smile, seeing two madmen getting married in the face of death. There could not be a better wedding for a priestess of Shar.~
@780 = ~Are you sure?~
@781 = ~It may be madness to have a wedding now, but I agree.~
@782 = ~It is madness to have a wedding now. Let's forget about it, until better times.~
@783 = ~Okay, then let's do it. *You hear a slight note of bitterness in her voice, but she tries to hide it and smiles* Let's move on.~
@784 = ~Then all that remains is to find a priest who will agree to perform the ceremony.~
@785 = ~I only saw the temple of Waukeen in the city, so it seems we have no choice. Try asking there. But I'm not sure they will agree - for priests of other religions, mentioning Shar during such a sacred rite may be... unacceptable.~

// ToB - Dialogue with Sister Fariel (SARTEM01.DLG - State 0 è 3)
@786 = ~I know this sounds crazy, but... could you perform a wedding ceremony? My friend and I want to get married.~
@787 = ~I'm not surprised by anything. We've been living under fire for a long time, and it teaches us to value loved ones and the connection between us. So I can perform the ceremony right now.~
@788 = ~There is one complication. I am a priestess of the goddess Shar. And it is important to me that Shar sees that I am faithful to her even at this moment. I will write the words that must be read during the ceremony. If you are ready to do so.~
@789 = ~No need to worry. This is not a temple to Selune or Mystra. Our goddess has nothing against others, but... everything has its price. To worship Waukeen, one must know wealth.~
@790 = ~Since you are asking for an unusual favor in unusual circumstances, the price will be high. Let's say 30,000 coins.~
@791 = ~Okay, I'm willing to pay that.~
@792 = ~I'm... a little short on money. Perhaps 20,000 would be okay?~
@793 = ~I'm... short on money. I'll come back later.~
@794 = ~No, that's too expensive. I'd rather stay single!~
@795 = ~Okay. 20,000 coins will do.~
@796 = ~Sorry, but no. This is too unusual a ritual for you. I can't do it for less than 30,000.~

@803 = ~Please state your names.~
@804 = ~<CHARNAME>.~
@805 = ~Getting married is an important step. When a person appears in your life, in whose soul you drown, as in a raging ocean, at the sight of whom your heart burns with flame, and the ground disappears from under your feet - that's when you understand that you have been swallowed by the element of love.~
@806 = ~There is a desire to talk about the most important things, to listen and hear each other, to cultivate trust and respect for each other.~
@807 = ~*Sister Fariel looks at the sheet where Shar-Teel wrote the text for the ceremony, which Shar herself would not object to. Frowning, she nevertheless reads what was written.*~
@808 = ~So, <CHARNAME>, do you vow to embrace your spouse as Shar's darkness shall one day embrace us all? Do you vow to face the lonely, unending void of her despair together, hand in hand?~
@809 = ~I vow.~
@810 = ~Shar-Teel, when death and darkness take you, do you acknowledge that your love will tie you together to drift in ceaseless nothingness?~
@811 = ~I acknowledge.~
@812 = ~Then, in the presence of the gods, I pronounce you husband and wife! You may kiss the bride.~
@813 = ~*You hug Shar-Teel tightly and kiss her. Then you remember the ring, for which you had discreetly measured her finger beforehand.* I had forgotten about the ring!~
@814 = ~Show it to me.~
@815 = ~*You hand her the wedding ring, precisely tailored to her ring finger. There is no decoration on the ring, for you have studied your friend's tastes well enough.*~
@816 = ~Put it on me. And give me yours.~
@817 = ~*You exchange the rings and perform the ceremony - thanking the gods that your hasty measurement was correct. Now Shar-Teel Dosan is your lawful wife.*~
@818 = ~Congratulations, little brother! *kisses the bride* Congratulations, sis!~
@819 = ~I don't know what to say, <CHARNAME>... I never thought I'd feel this way about all these ceremonies. But now it really means a lot to me.~
@820 = ~Advice and love to you!~
@821 = ~Are you done? We still have a lot to do.~
@822 = ~Finally, these sappy ceremonies are over. (Although, I must admit, it was spectacular.)~

@828 = ~Boo even cried when you took your vows! Let me wipe your eyes, kid.~
