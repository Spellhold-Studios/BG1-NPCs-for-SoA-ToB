# BG1 NPCs for SoA&ToB

## The new district of Athkatla (Water Gardens), as well as the old companions from BG1, who are back with you!

The mod adds to the game:
1) Athkatla New Area - the luxurious Water Gardens, where all the rich and famous of Athkatla go to unwind. All the inhabitants of the Water Gardens have hundreds and thousands of lines of dialogue, and these lines will change with each new conversation. What's more - during the day and at night, the dialogues can also differ, so you can talk to every resident in the area many times at different times and enjoy many different lines! And in the mansion of Lady Goldsword, parties are held in the evening and at night, and guests come there!
 
2) NPCs from BG1 into BG2. They have new banters, interjections, epilogues and a few of them have encounters, quests and romances as well.
NOTE: The mod is broken down into different components, allowing for easy mixing and matching with other mods that may also add NPCs from BG1.
Not all NPCs have the same amount of text. Shar-Teel, Garrick, Tiax, Coran and Safana, Xzar and Montaron as the most text.
The mod also contains a full-fledged romance between Garrick and Nalia, as well as a very specific romance between female PC and Montaron (this is more of a parody of a bad relationship than a romance in the usual sense of the word).

 
The mod is compatible with BG2, BG2: EE, BGT and EET.

This mod must be installed AFTER other NPC mods containing the same NPCs - in which case they will simply be skipped, but all the rest of the content of this mod will be available! In that way, you can still install Kulyok's Xan or Lava's Quayle and still enjoy the rest of the mod. For example, if a player were to have other version of Quayle installed and he tried to install the component 'Gnomes is the City: Tiax and Quayle', installer would skip over Smiling Imp's Quayle. Thus, Tiax from this mod and Lava's Quayle would appear in the game.
Also compatible with the "The Darkest Day" mod - but on "classic" (non-EE) version of game "BG1 NPCs for SoA & ToB" must be installed AFTER "TDD" mod, in this case two identical NPCs will not appear in the game.
